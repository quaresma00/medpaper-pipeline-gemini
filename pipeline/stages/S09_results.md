# S09 - Results

## Purpose
Write the Results section against the approved artifact plan, before the artifacts are
rendered. The plan fixes what each display contains, so the prose can be written from the
result JSONs and then reconciled at S12 once the files exist.

## Inputs
- `01_protocol/artifact_plan.json` - the display items and what each one shows
- `03_analysis/results/*.json` - every number
- `05_figures/legends.md`, `04_tables/table_captions.md` - so the prose does not repeat them

## Procedure
1. Order the Results the way the artifact plan is ordered: cohort/flow, baseline
   characteristics, primary analysis, secondary analyses, sensitivity analyses.
2. Write `project/07_manuscript/results.md`. Every display item in the plan must be cited
   at least once, in order, as `(Figure 1)`, `(Table 2)`, `(Figure S1)`, `(Table S1)`.
   The gate rejects citations to items not in the plan, and items never cited.
3. Report effects the way the design demands: point estimate, 95% CI, then the p-value -
   never a bare p. Copy the values from the result JSONs; do not re-round to look tidier
   than the analysis was.
4. Do not interpret. No "importantly", no "consistent with prior work", no mechanism.
   Those belong in the Discussion.
5. Do not restate a table row by row. The prose carries the findings the reader must not
   miss; the table carries the rest.

## Outputs
- `07_manuscript/results.md`

## Hard rules
- ONE section file this stage.
- Every number traceable to results JSON.
- Every figure/table citation matches `artifact_plan.json` exactly, including
  supplementary numbering.
- No claim about a result you did not compute. If a reviewer would ask "where is the
  test for that", either run it (loop to S05) or do not claim it.
