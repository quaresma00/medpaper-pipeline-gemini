# S22 - Journal-specific, fact-preserving polish

## Purpose
Give the journal-specific integration copy one language pass without changing a number,
citekey, figure/table reference or scientific claim. The accepted scientific master remains
unchanged.

## Procedure
1. Snapshot before editing:
```
uv run python tools/text/polish.py snapshot
```
   The tool snapshots `08_submission/integration/full_manuscript.md` plus its supplementary
   Methods and administrative files. It never snapshots or edits the frozen S19 sources.
2. Run `tools/text/polish.py lint`, fix blocking AI tells and house-style defects, and align
   abstract structure, spelling, word/reference limits and permitted headings with the
   chosen journal. Preserve medical-journal prose: continuous narrative, calibrated claims,
   concise Methods in the main paper, and detailed implementation only in the supplement.
3. Keep Keywords immediately after the Abstract, comma-delimited, 3-6 items. Preserve the
   explicit References heading and concise Figure legends at the end.
4. Run `tools/text/polish.py diff` and `tools/text/polish.py lint` again. Restore and redo
   any wording edit that loses or adds a number, citation or artifact reference.
5. Write `polish_log.md` with `AI patterns removed`, `Language changes by section`, `House
   style decisions`, `Cut to meet journal limits`, `Read by eye`, `Tier-B phrases kept`.
6. Reread the complete manuscript and optional supplementary Methods, then record
   `polish_reviewed YES` with a concrete reason.

## Outputs
- `08_submission/integration/polish_report.json`
- `08_submission/integration/polish_log.md`

## Hard rules
- Wording only. Never change a number, citekey, artifact reference or conclusion strength.
- Never edit `07_manuscript/full_manuscript.md` or any other frozen scientific-master file to
  meet one journal's requirements. All such presentation changes stay inside
  `08_submission/integration/` and the resulting bundle.
- Do not re-take the snapshot to hide a failed fact-preservation diff.
- Do not add content or an AI-use disclosure during polishing.

## Close
```
uv run python tools/wf.py check
uv run python tools/wf.py advance --note "journal polish complete; facts preserved; abstract/main/reference limits pass; read by eye"
```
