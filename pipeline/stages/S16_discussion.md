# S16 - Discussion

## Purpose
Interpret the finding against the literature you actually read. One file, this stage only.

## Inputs
- `06_refs/deepread/*.md` - the ~5 full texts, read
- `06_refs/library.json` - abstracts for the wider context
- `03_analysis/notes.md` -> `Discussion points`, `Limitations`, `Surprises`
- `07_manuscript/results.md` - what you may interpret (and nothing beyond it)
- `01_protocol/protocol_diff.md` - deviations that must be owned as limitations

## Procedure
1. Structure, in this order:
   1. **Principal finding** - one paragraph, plain, no hedging, no new numbers.
   2. **Comparison with prior work** - this is where the deep reads earn their place.
      Where you agree, say with whom and why. Where you disagree, name the study and give a
      mechanistic or methodological reason (population, exposure definition, follow-up,
      adjustment set, era). Every deep-read paper must appear here; the gate checks it.
   3. **Interpretation / mechanism** - clearly labelled as inference, not as demonstrated.
   4. **Clinical or research implications** - proportionate to the evidence. A single
      observational study does not change practice.
   5. **Strengths and limitations** - specific and quantified. Include every protocol
      deviation from `protocol_diff.md`, residual confounding, generalisability limits,
      power, and measurement error. State the direction each bias would push the estimate.
   6. **Conclusion** - two or three sentences, no stronger than the Results support.
2. Write `project/07_manuscript/discussion.md` with pandoc citations `[@key]`.
3. Check the counts: `uv run python tools/wf.py check` (word and reference targets, and that every
   deep-read paper is cited).

## Outputs
- `07_manuscript/discussion.md`

## Hard rules
- ONE section file this stage.
- No new results. Any number here must already be in `results.md` and in a results JSON.
- No causal language for an observational design. "Associated with", not "leads to".
- Limitations are not a list of generic caveats. "Single-centre design" alone is not a
  limitation section; say what it does to the estimate.
- Do not claim a finding is "the first" unless S02's search supports it, and cite that.
- No stock closers: not "further studies are warranted" as the whole future-work paragraph,
  not "paves the way", not "holds promise".
