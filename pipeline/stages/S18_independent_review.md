# S18 - Independent publication-readiness review

## Purpose
Test the frozen complete manuscript, supplementary Methods and every table before the user
edits them. This is an independent scientific/editorial audit, not another writing pass.

## Procedure
1. Freeze the inputs for this audit: `07_manuscript/full_manuscript.md`,
   `07_manuscript/supplementary_methods.md` when present, every workbook under
   `04_tables/main/` and `04_tables/supplementary/`, and `01_protocol/artifact_plan.json`.
   Do not change them while the reviewer is working.
2. Spawn exactly one independent subagent. Give it the frozen paths and ask it to review
   only; it must not edit files or rewrite the paper. The reviewer must judge whether the
   study could be published in a legitimate current SCIE journal, including a realistic
   low-impact/Q3/Q4 venue, rather than whether it belongs in a top journal.
3. Require the reviewer to check scientific validity, internal consistency, reporting
   completeness, whether the Methods support reproducibility without bloating the main
   text, whether tables/supplement agree with the manuscript, claim strength, fatal versus
   correctable problems, and the likely acceptance ceiling. It must distinguish data or
   design barriers from presentation defects.
   Check legend meaning in context: panel mapping and decoding information must suffice
   without repeating Results, including paraphrased findings that a phrase check cannot catch.
   Verify that centralized abbreviation definitions cover the terms used in the figures and
   tables, including mixed-case medical terms; do not treat every uppercase label as an acronym.
4. Preserve the review in `project/07_manuscript/independent_publishability_review.md`
   under these exact headings: `Verdict`, `Critical barriers`, `Scientific validity`,
   `Reporting completeness`, `Tables and supplementary material`, `Journal suitability`,
   `Required revisions`, `Post-revision outlook`.
5. Record one decision:
```
uv run python tools/wf.py decide independent_publishability "READY|REVISE|NOT_READY" --why "<one-sentence basis from the independent review>"
```
   `READY` means ready for the user's review and realistic SCIE targeting; `REVISE` means
   potentially publishable after listed corrections; `NOT_READY` means a material validity
   barrier remains. The workflow may still advance so the user can inspect the evidence.

## Outputs
- `07_manuscript/independent_publishability_review.md`

## Hard rules
- One independent reviewer only; no review committee and no repeated audit of unchanged
  material.
- The reviewer receives the full manuscript, optional supplementary Methods and tables,
  not isolated excerpts.
- Do not let the reviewer silently edit the frozen source or manufacture missing evidence.
- A low impact factor is not a defect when the journal is current SCIE and a realistic fit.

## Close
```
uv run python tools/wf.py check
uv run python tools/wf.py advance --note "independent verdict=<READY|REVISE|NOT_READY>; critical barriers: <none or list>; frozen files unchanged"
